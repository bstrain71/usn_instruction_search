There is a huge corpus of instructions that USN personnel have to sort through in order to get information - an easy way to query this corpus to find relevant instructions given a topic would save everyone time and energy. There is no objective metric with which to measure 'accuracy' but the searches have consistently returned sane and sensible results during operator testing."
